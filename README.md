LootWorld.io White Paper “Into The Metaverse”

LootWorld is a Community Built Metaverse


PROLOGUE

A long forgotten world of Magic and Mystery.  Rolling hills and dark forests.  In the distance, the tall spires of a lost city can be seen.​

For those yearning for adventure, your journey begins here… ​


INTRODUCTION 

LootWorld is a Metaverse NFT project, focusing on Players and Creators. Using the Minecraft platform as a base, we are creating a fully immersive, vibrant Metaverse. With the help of Community Builders, we are an ever changing, expansive virtual world.
 
Minted NFTs are given utility in LootWorld as Playable Characters. With future Land Plots being available that will expand and enhance LootWorld

LootWorld is an ever evolving Metaverse. As the core team works relentlessly on adding new assets and features into the main LootWorld map, the Community Builders are able to freely modify their own surrounding Plots.    

The only limit in LootWorld is your imagination.

The project is also backed by the $LOOT token, the original project’s ERC20 Token.

In-Game transactions use the $GEMS token that sits on the Polygon Chain.

LootWorld is building a vibrant Metaverse Economy.


ACCESS AND GAMEPLAY

Access to the LootWorld Metaverse is granted by holding and staking one or more Playable Character NFTs. These can be obtained from the LootWorld.io minting page.  The first class of characters are Wizards. 

Players must own Minecraft 1.18 Java Edition in order to access LootWorld. Once connected to our server, users need to type “/verify” in chat, this will open the Metamask verification window and allow them to authenticate.

The LootWorld Minecraft server operates in PvP Enabled Survival Mode using Java Edition 1.18. Player items can be stored in a personal Ender Chest accessed with the “/ec” command.  

After verifying in the Lobby, users are transported to the LootWorld Citadel to begin their adventure.


THE MAP AND CITADEL

LootWorld sits on an enormous 2000 x 2000 Map.  At its heart is The Citadel.  This sprawling city is the jewel of the LootWorld Metaverse:  A place to meet, explore, and play.  In the centre of The Citadel lies the Colosseum, a huge ancient arena.  Some say that long ago this space was used for Epic Battles, viewed by thousands. Wizards would battle for their honour, casting spells to the amazement of the crowd.  Legend has it that these battles will one day return…

Surrounding the main 2000 x 2000 Map are 100 x 100 Land Plots that can be purchased by users.

NFT LAND PLOTS

LootWorld allows for users to buy and freely modify Land Plots.  Each Plot is linked to an underlying NFT that can be purchased using $GEMS or on the secondary market.  These 100 x 100 Plots surround the main LootWorld map.  Owners of these NFTs can freely modify their Plots any way they see fit.  Using one of these Plots any 3rd party is able to have a presence within LootWorld.  

Plot Owners can set a cost on activities or private sections within their Plot that must be paid to gain entry. For example, they might wish to charge for entry to a Race Course, or Obstacle Course.  The Plot owner receives 90% of all revenue generated in their Plot (10% is retained by us).  The possibilities are endless as we create a vibrant Metaverse Economy.

NFT STAKING

NFT owners are able to Stake their NFTs on the platform. In return they are rewarded with $GEMS.  These reward tokens can be used in-game and for NFT purchases such as Land Plots. They are also tradable, meaning a potential source of passive income.  Rewards are boosted the longer the NFT is staked, giving incentive for users to keep their NFTs staked and in turn reducing the number available to purchase on secondary markets. This should result in positive price action on said markets.  It is a requirement for users  to stake their NFT in order to access LootWorld.

PLOT STAKING

In order to modify a Plot, the underlying Plot NFT must be staked on the Platform.  Any minted Plot is automatically staked in order to save gas.  This means that if a user wishes to sell their Plot on the secondary market, they must first un-stake it which in turn locks the changes they have made.  Again the new owner would need to stake the NFT in order to make any changes to their newly purchased Plot.


IN-GAME CURRENCY

All In-Game transactions use $GEMS. These tokens exist on the Polygon Network, allowing for super cheap and fast transactions.  With the Polygon network being able to achieve a speed of 7,200 transactions per second (compared to the 15 TPS achieved by the Ethereum blockchain) and incredibly cheap gas cost, we are able to deliver a feasible Micro Transactions at minimum cost - essential for a functioning Metaverse Economy.

Users can earn $GEMS in a number of ways.  

Staking their character NFT
Charging users for activities within their section
Winning Battle Tournaments
Completing Treasure Hunts 

$GEMS can be spent in a number of ways.

NFT Plots
Competing in Battle Tournaments
In-Game Items 
Poker and other games
Activities in User Sections

In the future, GEMS will also be tradable on the Uniswap Exchange. 

Future plans also include the ability for users to be able to purchase GEMS directly from the LootWorld site using standard fiat currency.


$LOOT TOKENOMICS AND STAKING

$LOOT is the project’s original token.  With a low 40k Supply and good liquidity, the token sits on the Ethereum Network.

The token now acts as a DAO Token, with holders given rights to vote the future and direction of the project.

Users can also stake the token on the LootWorld platform.

By staking $LOOT or $LOOT/ETH Liquidity, users receive Gold and Silver ERC20 token rewards.

The Silver Token is rewarded to users who stake the Loot Token.  Its utility is as a currency to mint NFTs.  As a staking reward token, there is no maximum supply of Silver.  The supply is kept low by automatically burning 90% of all Silver tokens that are used to claim NFTs

The Gold Token is rewarded to users who stake the $LOOT/ETH Liquidity Tokens.  Its utility is as a currency to mint NFTs.  As a staking reward token, there is no maximum supply of Gold.  The supply is kept low by automatically burning 90% of all Silver tokens that are used to mint NFTs

All three tokens can be bought and sold on the open market via exchanges such as Uniswap.org
